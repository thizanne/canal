** How to build

=ocamlbuild cormoran.native=

** How to run

- With default options: =./cormoran.native filename=
- For more options: =./cormoran.native --help=

** How to write source files

See the directory =tests/= for syntax examples.

Precautions:
- Expressions must contain at most one shared variable.
- Expressions in conditions must not contain any shared variable.

The typing pass should explain clearly any other issue when writing
a syntactically correct but semantically wrong file.

[[http://diy.inria.fr][Litmus]] tests syntax is also accepted with the =--litmus= option. Use
them with caution: they are expected to be correctly written (as they
are usually automatically generated) and won't be typechecked.
