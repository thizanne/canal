      The property to be checked is true whether the following fence
      is present or not.

      However:

      The analyser can verify it (with Mark, as of 6th Nov 2015) if :
      - Octagons are used, one step before widening
      - Polka is used and :
        - fence is present, one step before widening
        - fence is absent, `while` replaced by a `for` of 100
          iterations, 101 steps before widening

      The analyser cannot verify it if :
      - fence is present, Polka is used (non termination)
      - fence is absent, loop is a for-100, polka is used, less than
        101 steps before widening (terminates on a failure)
