* Tests

- =safe/= and =relaxed/= tests are usual examples of algorithms or
  program patterns.
 + =safe/= tests do verify all their properties. They can be considered
   as precision tests for the analyser.
 + =relaxed/= tests do not verify all their properties. They can be
   considered as soundness tests for the analyser.
- =other/= tests are various test files for helping development. They
  may or may not have properties, they may or may not verify them, and
  the program may not be able to analyse them in its current state.
- =litmus/= tests are automatically generated by the [[http://diy.inria.fr/][diy]] tool. They
  are also splitted in =safe/= and =relaxed/= directories.
